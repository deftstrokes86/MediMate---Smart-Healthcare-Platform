## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#7FBCEF) to convey trust, calmness, and health. The blue creates a sense of reliability.
- Background color: Light blue (#EAF4FC), very desaturated, is calming and unobtrusive.
- Accent color: Light green (#A0E8AF), which provides a contrast to the primary color without being jarring. Use for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, which combines a modern look and a little warmth or personality; suitable for headlines or body text.
- Use modern, minimalist icons representing different medical specialties, symptoms, and actions (e.g., a stethoscope for cardiology, a pill for prescription).
- Clean, intuitive layout with clear sections for patient profiles, symptom checker, doctor listings, and appointment scheduling.
- Subtle transitions and animations for loading screens and interactive elements (e.g., expanding doctor profiles, map animations) to enhance user experience.
